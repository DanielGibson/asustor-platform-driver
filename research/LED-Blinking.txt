Not the same chip, but blinking control seems to be the same
(but no BREATH support): http://www.datasheet39.com/PDF/739483/IT8720F-datasheet.html

The frequency table below and the macros and IT87_REG_GP_LED_CTRL_PIN_MAPPING[]
are from asustors GPL kernel code (that seems to be very incomplete, which
wouldn't really be GPL-conformant..), can be downloaded at:

Bits for GP LED Blinking Pin Mapping Register (Index F8h for LED Blinking 1, FAh for 2)
* 7   SMBus Isolation on GP92-95 0: Bypass (Default, AVCC3 ON), 1: Isolation (AVCC3 OFF)
      On some other chips like IT8720F, this bit was just Reserved
* 6   (Reserved)
* 5:0 GP LED Blinking 1 Location (from GPLED_TO_LOCATION() macro),
      see also Location Mapping Table at the end of this file
      (Note that I couldn't get this to work with other LEDs than GP47, aka green:status)

Bits for GP LED Blinking Control Register (Index F9h for LED Blinking 1, FBh for 2), on IT8625E:
* 7:6 also frequency selection, see table below
* 5   "GP LED Blinking 1 Short Low Pulse Enable"
      Somehow makes the "On" cycles shorter - seems kinda redundant with the 20/25% duty cycles?
* 4   "LED Blinking 1 Pin Mapping Register Clear" 0: Disable 1: Enable
      "This function is activated when PANSWH# is low for over 4 seconds"
      PANSWH# = "Main Power Switch Button Input #" apparently?
      OR GP43, depending on bit 3 of reg 28h (Multi-Function Pin Slection Register),
      at least on IT8720F
* 3:1 frequency selection, see table below
* 0   "GP LED Blinking 1 Output Low Enable"
      "If set to 1, this PIN will always output low and can be used to control
       the status of non-S3 LEDs. For example, when S0 is set, the output is
       low and the LED is always on (provided that the LED hardware is
       set to low-level conduction)." (from translated https://icode.best/i/96302341329066)
      In practice, at least on my AS5402T, setting this bit seems to make the LED light up
      constantly, so I'll add this as mode 11

Other chips also support blinking control, but might support fewer modes, maybe only 0-3 or 0-7,
and the modes might be different. I *think* that mode 11 for "always on" should work for the vast
majority, at least the bit set there was listed in all datasheets (but never really described).

On IT8712F, IT8720F, IT8722F, IT8728F, IT8772E IT8781F - IT8783F, IT8783E
the blinking control register is slightly different, but (probably?)
mostly compatible (for modes 1-7 and 11):
* 0   "GP LED blinking X output low enable", same as IT8625E
* 1-2 frequency control (0: 4Hz, 1: 1Hz, 2: 0.25Hz, 3: 0.125Hz)
* 3   LED blinking short low pulse enable - seems to make the "on" cycles shorter
* 4-7 Reserved

NOTE: It's quite possible (and probable) that more IT87xx chips behave like this,
these are the ones I could find data sheets for.

On IT8673F, it's quite different. Everything is still in the GPIO (LDN=07h) space,
but the registers are very different (seems to be a rather old chip)..
see also http://www.datasheet39.com/PDF/502101/IT8673F-datasheet.html
I'm documenting this here for the sake of completeness, but will not implement it.

F8h is the "Panel Button De-bounce Control Register/GP LED Blinking 2 Control Register":
* 7   GP LED 2 short low pulse enable
* 6:5 GP LED 2 frequency control (0: 4Hz, 1: 1Hz, 2: 0.25Hz, 3: 0.125Hz)
* 4   GP LED Output low enable
* 3   IRQ output mode 0: Edge mode 1: Level mode (?!)
* 2   IRQ output enable (0: disable, 1: enable)
* 1:0 De-bounce time selection. 0: 8ms, 1: 16ms, 2: 32ms, 3: 64ms (?!)

FAh is the "GP LED Blinking 1 Pin Mapping Register", FCh is the same for GP LED Blinking 2
* 7:6 Reserved
* 5:0 GP LED Blinking 1 Location
  Mapping like in the newer chips, but only goes up to 001 111 / GPIO17

FBh is the "GP LED Blinking Control and RING# Pin Mapping Register"
* 7   Reserved
* 6-4 Location of RING# (whatever that is, something about powering on a machine from Modem or Fax)
* 3   GPL LED 1 short low pulse enable
* 2-1 GP LED 1 frequency control (0: 4Hz, 1: 1Hz, 2: 0.25Hz, 3: 0.125Hz)
* 0   GP LED 1 Output low enabled

IT8671F and IT8687R are even more different, just a link for that (they're even older):

### IT8625E Breath LED Control ###

DAh Bits, for Breath LED Control Register 1
* 6:7 (Reserved)
* 5:4 BREATH LED Maximum Duty Cycle Select (HMXD)
      00b: 40h; 01b: 80h; 10b: C0h; 11b: FFh
* 3:2 BREATH LED Duty Decreasing Step (DDS) - same values as DIS
* 1:0 BREATH LED Duty Increasing Step (DIS)
      00b: 1h; 01b: 2h; 10b: 4h; 11b: 8h

DBh Bits, for Breath LED Control Register 2
* 7   BREATH LED BLINK Enable - 0: Disable; 1; Enable
      Note: Breathing LED function is for LED Blinking 1 only.
* 6:4 BREATH LED Maximum Duty Cycle Delay Period (HMXDD)
      same values as HZDD
* 3   (Reserved)
* 2:0 BREATH LED Zero Duty Cycle Delay Period (HZDD)
      011b: 1/2 s; 100b: 1s; 101b: 2s; 110b: 4s

Note: According to https://icode.best/i/96302341329066, BREATH can only be configured for LED1
Furthermore, the BREATH stuff above is only for reference, I didn't implement support for it,
and I couldn't find any reference to it in any public data sheet, so it might be only implemented
in IT8625E.
